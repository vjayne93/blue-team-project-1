The purpose of this analysis is to examine and analyze the root causes of individuals' feelings of anxiety and depression from 2020 to 2023. We hypothesized that the states with the lowest reports of anxiety and depression
(hereafter, referred to as 'Low') would have a more favorable quality of life as measured by data on food insecurity, housing insecurity, health care, excess deaths, wages and per capita income, education spending,
educational attainment, and student debt burden. Conversely, we expected the states with the highest rates of self-reported depression and anxiety (hereafter, referred to as 'High') to experience a markedly poorer quality of
life based on these same factors. We hypothsized that self-reported mental illness is significantly impacted by external factors. We compared the top 3 High states with the top 3 Low states. 

**Our analysis determined the following**
Low states outperformed High states:
By 81% in food insecurity
By 73% in housing insecurity
By 22% in # of deaths per 100k people caused by Alzheimers and Dementia
By 109% in # of deaths per 100k people caused by circulatory diseases
By 12% in # of deaths per 100k people caused by Malignant Neoplasms
By 397% in # of deaths per 100k people caused by other select causes
By 269% in # of deaths per 100k people caused by respiratory diseases
By 29% in average income
By 22% in total per capita public school funding
By 16% in Student Loan amounts

Low states also have higher percentages of the population enrolled in Medicare, higher percentages insured by their employers, and lower percentages enrolled in Medicaid or uninsured.
High states had twice the rate of high school drop outs and 41% fewer college graduates per capita. 


**Conclusion:**
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs constitutes a psychological motivational theory presenting a structured model of five fundamental human needs essential for achieving a sense of fulfillment in life. Often visualized as a 
pyramid, the initial two tiers of this model encompass basic physiological requirements like food, water, and shelter, along with safety and security needs such as health, employment, and property. Our examination 
primarily focuses on these foundational tiers, establishing a parallel with the theory that individuals experiencing fulfillment in their basic needs are prone to lower levels of anxiety and depression. Moreover, we 
deduce a clear correlation, asserting that states investing more in necessities-oriented initiatives such as public school funding, health insurance subsidies, and food programs for the underprivileged can contribute to 
heightened citizen satisfaction and decreased instances of anxiety and depression.
