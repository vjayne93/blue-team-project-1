List of sources for our data include the United States Census Bureau, the Household Pulse Survey, CDC (Weekly Counts of Death by Jurisdiction and Select Causes of Death) Data, CDC (VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts) Data, and US Department of Health and Human 
Services.

The purpose of this analysis is to examine and analyze the root causes of individuals' feelings of anxiety and depression from 2020 to 2023. We hypothesized that the states with the lowest reports of anxiety and depression
(hereafter, referred to as 'Low') would have a more favorable quality of life as measured by data on food insecurity, housing insecurity, health care, excess deaths, wages and per capita income, education spending,
educational attainment, and student debt burden. Conversely, we expected the states with the highest rates of self-reported depression and anxiety (hereafter, referred to as 'High') to experience a markedly poorer quality of
life based on these same factors. We hypothsized that self-reported mental illness is significantly impacted by external factors. We compared the top 3 High states with the top 3 Low states. 

**Our analysis determined the following**
Low states outperformed High states:
By 81% in food insecurity
By 73% in housing insecurity
By 22% in # of deaths per 100k people caused by Alzheimers and Dementia
By 109% in # of deaths per 100k people caused by circulatory diseases
By 12% in # of deaths per 100k people caused by Malignant Neoplasms
By 397% in # of deaths per 100k people caused by other select causes
By 269% in # of deaths per 100k people caused by respiratory diseases
By 29% in average income
By 22% in total per capita public school funding
By 16% in Student Loan amounts

Low states also have higher percentages of the population enrolled in Medicare, higher percentages insured by their employers, and lower percentages enrolled in Medicaid or uninsured.
High states had twice the rate of high school drop outs and 41% fewer college graduates per capita. 


**Conclusion:**
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs serves as a psychological motivational theory that delineates a structured model comprising five fundamental human needs crucial for attaining a sense of fulfillment in life. Depicted often as a pyramid, the initial two tiers of this model
encompass basic physiological necessities such as food, water, and shelter, alongside safety and security needs like health, employment, and property. Our exploration centers primarily on these foundational tiers, drawing parallels with the theory that individuals 
experiencing fulfillment in these basic needs are inclined towards lower levels of anxiety and depression.

Furthermore, we discern a distinct correlation, affirming that states prioritizing necessities-oriented initiatives, such as increased public school funding, health insurance subsidies, and food programs for the underprivileged, can contribute significantly to 
heightened citizen satisfaction and reduced instances of anxiety and depression. Education emerges as a noteworthy external factor influencing a person's overall mental health. The data underscores that states with lower anxiety and depression exhibit higher educational 
attainment and lower average debt per borrower.

States with lower anxiety and depression levels boast 70% of the population with higher educational attainment, in contrast to 57% in states grappling with higher anxiety and depression. Notably, higher education is often linked with larger student loan amounts, which 
can become a source of chronic worry and stress. In states experiencing higher anxiety and depression, the student debt levels are approximately 10% higher compared to states with lower anxiety and depression.
